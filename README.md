# Human Fetal Heart Atlas

## Description
+ PLEASE PROVIDE THE LINK TO THE PAPER ONCE PREPRINTED/PUBLISHED
+ COUPLE OF LINES TO DESCRIBE THE PROJECT
+ ADD WORKFLOW OF THE STUDY



## Directory structure
* the code directory contains all the R scripts used for:
   + snRNA data analysis,
   + visualization, 
   + snRNA and spatial transcriptomics data integration, and 
   + trajectory analysis  
   
  
* figures/ directory contains the html and pdf files of the generated figures 

* results/ directory contains the results of snRNA data analysis, its integration with spatial transcriptomics data and trajectory analysis  

* **docs/ (I DID NOT GET THE PURPOSE OF THIS FOLDER. OUR RMARKDOWN FILES CONTAINS ALL THE INFORMATION)**

* **data/ (I THINK IT IS BETTER TO PROVIDE THE LINK TO DATA INSTEAD OF UPLOADING ON GITHUB. OTHER PAPERS HAVE USED THE SIMILAR APPROACH)**
